Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

I take a look at the data from a high-level using Python to see the type of features that has been collected on employees, then formulate a question and hypothesis 
related to employee attrition at this company. Then an exploratory analysis was conducted using Python and some libraries; numpy and pandas for data cleaning and 
manipulation, statsmodels for statistical analysis, and seaborn for plotting.
