 The purpose of this project was to determine if the toxicity of a mushroom can be accurately predicted given its set of physical and environmental features. Further analysis was conducted to uncover insights into which mushroom features are most commonly associated with a mushroom being poisonous or edible.

This project contains two main parts: 
1. A Jupyter notebook [(Project link)](https://github.com/Zaltaer/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Mushroom%20classification%20project/JasonRobathan%20-%20Capstone%20-%20Mushrooms.ipynb) which contains: my exploratory and statistical data analysis using Python and relevant libraries and my machine learning modelling for the predictive tasks of identifying mushroom toxicity
2. A dashboard with visual representations of my findings hosted on Tableau public, linked here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jason1251/viz/MushroomToxicityClassification/Story1
